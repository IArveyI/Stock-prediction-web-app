# Stock-prediction-web-app
This project allows the prediction of the stock values of different companies through the Facebook Prophet tool, which allows an automated and more efficient prediction for the implementation of the models. To visualize the data, a web application built with the streamlit library was used, which allows the creation of apps in a fast and simple way.
